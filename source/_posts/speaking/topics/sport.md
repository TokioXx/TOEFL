#### Describe a sport you like

Well, my favorite sport is tennis, because I can share time with friends while playing tennis. These interation would strenthen our friendship. And another important thing is it's safety. You are unlikely to be enjoried. In fact, most of the enjories are related to overuse. But with proper exercises, the risk would be minimized, or even elimilated. With these reasons, it is supposed to be popular. 

#### Why should people play sports

Obviously, a sedentary lifestyle is harmful for our health, so we need some exercise to keep fit. It is good for both mental and physical health. Once I felt exhausted after several hours work, so I had a break and went to play sports. And the magic thing is that I felt energetic again only one hour later. My body was relaxed and my energy was recharged.
