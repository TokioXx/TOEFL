#### Do you prefer public transportation, or private transportation?

Well, I think both types of transportation have their advantages, so it depends. It's nice to have the freedom of your own car to go where you want to go. But I prefer the metro in the rush hour because it's quicker than a private car in the traffic jams.

#### How offen do you take public transportation?

Well, I take the metro every weekend when I go out with my friends. I also take the bus when it is not the rush hour. Public transport in China is cheap, reliable, and convenient, and the metro is particularly fast.  

#### Will you ride a bike to work in the future?

Definitely, I hope to ride to work in the future. Many people are now aware of the importance of protecting our envoriment. Riding a bike is good for the environment. It doesn't cause pollution and is also beneficial for you own healthy.

#### Is driving to work popular in your country?

I would say it is becoming popular. As more and more people can enjoy a car and enjoy the convenience it brings. However, with the rise in the number of car on the road, air pollution has become serious and it is hard to find a parking place.
