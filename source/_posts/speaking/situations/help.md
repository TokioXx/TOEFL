#### Do you like help strangers?

Well, to tell you the truth, that depends on the situation. Sometimes I am little wary of strangers. For example, people who ask me for money on the street. If someone needs practical help, I am very happy to give a hand.

#### When was the last time you helped others?

A few weeks ago, I saw a lady with her baby at the metro station. She needed help to get the pushchair downstairs. I was very happy to be helpful.

#### Have you ever refused to help others?

Yes, sometimes you would see baggers who ask for cash on the street. But these people are not always what they seem, sometimes they are used by others to make money. So I don't always give them changes when they ask for it. 

#### Will you keep helping others in the future?

Off cause I will, because I have been helped many times. I think if someone has done a good turn for you, you should try to do one for someone else who needs help. In this way, the world would become a kinder place.
