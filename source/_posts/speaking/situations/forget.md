#### Have you ever forgotton to do something important?

Well, I've sometimes forgotton to do my homework, and got into trouble for not handing it in. I also once forgot my grandmather's birthday and did not ring her. Luckily, my mom reminded me and I made a call, which made her very happy.

#### What do you remember to do everyday?

Well, basically the important thing is to get up early and attend class on time, so I try to get everything ready the night before. Brushing teeth and taking a shower are also my daily routine.

#### Why do old people forget about things so easily?

Well, old people's brains age, so they begin to lose memory. They may remember things from their youth very clearly, but have forgotton things from yesterday. They may even forget they are wearing their glasses and go looking for them.

#### What may help people to remember things?

Making a todo list could help us remember things we have to do today. Dairy also helps. Nowadays we have a planner on our mobile phone which can be very useful. It will remind us of things we have to do and events such as a friend's birthday.
