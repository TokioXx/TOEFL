#### Are you good at time management?

I would say I have improved. When I was a child, I would rely on teachers and parents to manage my time, and remind me of what I should be doing. Nowadays, I am much more proactive trying my best make time tables and stick to them.

#### How do you manage time?

Time is precious. At the beginning of a new term, I write down some goals I want to reach, or some dreams I want to fulfill. I will make a timetable for my spare time and try stick to it. Then at the end of the term, I would not feel that I have wasted too much time.

#### Do you think time management is important?

I really think time management is crucial for all of us. We lead busy lives and our own time has become very limited. We need to know how to plan our time to keep ourselves efficient.

#### Have ever have difficulties in following your plan?
 
Yes, I have failed in my plans many times, but each time I feel I can learn from my failure. Dreams are not always achievable, but they can give you a direction. As long as you make progress, you are one step closer to your goals.
