#### Do you enjoy sleeping?

Well, to tell you the truth, as someone who never gets enough sleep, I do enjoy sleep. As a student, I have to be very ealry for classes. I welcome the end of the day when I can finally go to sleep.

Well, that rather depends on what I am doing. At university I probably only get around six hours' sleep, since there is so much work to get finished. However, in the holidays I may sleep around ten hours and get up much later.

My usual bedtime would be around midnight. There are many things I may need to do after work, such as cooking, washing clothes, and doing some exercise.

#### Can you sleep well in the noisy environment?

When I was a yound child, I had no problem sleeping anywhere. Even in a noisy, crowded place, I could easily take a nap. However, nowadays I find it much harder for me to switch off. If I hear a lot noisy distractions all around, it's impossible for me to sleep.
