#### Do you like doing things in a hurry?

Well, actually I don't enjoy doing things in a hurry, because it can be quite stressful. For example, the morning routine. When you oversleep and have to get ready in a hurry, you may forget something you need.

#### When was the last time you did something in a hurry?

Well, the last time was probably when I was going home for the winter holiday. I had my train ticket booked, so I had to get to the train station at a centain time. But the traffic congestion delayed me, in the end I just only made it.

#### What kind of things will you never do in a hurry?

I would probably never do these things in a rush, such as crossing a busy road, or using a sharp life. Doing those things needs care and attention. Also, making important desicions in life are worth taking time over.

#### Why do people make mistakes more easily when they are in a hurry?

Well, the reason is mainly that when you are rushed you are not being careful. Your mind is just trying to do things as quickly as possible. In such a situation you tend to pay less attention to the details, so you might make mistakes.
