#### Would you like to be alone?

Think about it, I do like to be alone sometimes. It gives me space and some quite time to think about my life. I also would rather to be alone when I am really sick.

#### Spending time with your friends or staying at home alone?

Well, My answer would really have to be both. I love spending time with my best friends, because we understand each other and have similiar interests. We have a lot of fun together. Sometime however, I enjoy staying at home alone when I am really tired and need to chill out. I just want some time to myself.

#### What do you like to do when you are alone?

When I am alone, I like to play my guitar and listen to music. I think music brings a lot of pleasure to me. Sometimes I like to write my own songs, usually they are about the experiences in my own life.

#### When was the last time you were alone?

It was last time when I went home alone. My parents decided to go out shopping, but as I didn't like crowd shops, I chose to stay at home. I made myself some tasty snacks and then watched TV.
