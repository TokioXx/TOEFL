#### Do you like hanging out?

Well, I think young people like me do enjoy hanging out with friends, especially because we lead busy lives and have a lot of pressure on us. Wherever we get a chance to relax, we go out chatting, eating, and watching movie together.

#### Who do you usually like to hang out with?

I thinks it would have to be my best friends. They means a lot to me, because they understand me. Sometimes we help each other through difficulties. Other times, although we don't say too much, but we enjoy each other's company.

#### How often do you hang out with friends?

Well, I usually have a break and meet up with my friends at weekends. And I also have some good friends in my hometown, but I could only see them in the holidays.

#### Where do you like to go?

Generally, I may do a bit of shopping with my friends, and then go for a nice meal together. Also, we often go and watch a movie in the evenings. There is a cinema not far from our university, so it is a very convenient place to go.
