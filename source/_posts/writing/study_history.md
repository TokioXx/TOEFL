#### 以史为鉴

All students should be required to take history classes, regradless of their own academic interests. We are all traveller in time who constantly draw on our past individual experiences in judging the present; and if we have individually experienced anything similiar to the present situation that we are in, we rely on our collective memery - the very thing that we called history. And since we view present occurences in this time perspective, the past decisions and actions also set precedent for our futher options and precautions. Why there are concerted effort to curb the spread of AIDS across the world? That is due to the lesson we learned from the ravage of Black Death. As the famous saying goes, "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it." 

#### 提高文化认知

By looking at the different history, students can build up a better understanding of why certain people act the way they do. By learning the history of USA we can find out why race tensions continued on past the abolition of slavery and arguably remain today. Through studing at the various tributaries of humanity, students could gain a broad culture awareness.

#### 历史带来的好处更隐晦

In a society that quite correctly expects education to serve useful purpose, the function of history can be difficult to define than those of engineering or medicine. History is in fact very useful, actually indispensable, but the products of studying history is sometime less tangible, than those that stem from some other disciplines.

#### history help us understand people and society

In the first place, history offers a wealth of information about how human and societies behave. Understanding the operations of people and societies is difficult, though a number of disciplines make the attempt. The exclusive reliance on current data would needlessly handicap our effort. How can we evaluate war if the nation is at peace - unless we use the historical data? How can we understand the role that beliefs play in shaping family life, if we don't use what we know about experiences in the past. Consequently, history must serve, however inperfectly, as our laboratory, and data from the past must serve as our most vital evidence in the unavoidable quest to figure out why our complex species behave as they do.

#### history help us understand changes of the societies we live in

history help us understand how the society we live in changes. The past cause the present, and so does future. A fairly recent history is suffice to explain a major development in society, but we need to look further back to identify the causes of change. Only through study history can we grasp how things change; only through history can we begin to comprehend the factors that cause the change; and only through history can we understand what elements of a society or an institution persist despite change.

#### History Contributes to Moral Understanding

History provides a terrain for moral contemplation. Study of stories of the individuals and the situations in the past allow a student to test his or her moral sense, and hone it against of the complexities the individuals had faced in difficult settings. People who have weathered adversities, not just in some work of fictions, but also in real, historical circumstances can provide inspiration. "History teaching by example" is one phrase that describle the use of the study of the past - the study not only of heros, the great men and women who successfully work through moral dilemmas, but also of more ordinary people who provide lessons in courage, diligence, or constructive protest.
