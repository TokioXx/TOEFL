#### Convenience of Public Transportation

Driving everywhere can be a burden in a city of any size. Big cities often lack sufficient parking or charge high rates for the available parking options. But public transportation options fill this void, making owning a car in a big city unnecessary. Whether traveling by taxi, subway (called the “EL” in Chicago), or bus, you can reach your destination in a city for a reasonable price, without the hassle of searching for a parking spot.

Many city dwellers combine transportation with exercise, preferring to walk or ride a bike around town. Whether you’re looking for a quick, stress-free way to navigate around town or want a way to drastically cut down on the expense of getting around, big city public transportation is the obvious choice.

#### Endless Entertainment Options 

Cities provide a wide array of entertainment options for any night of the week. Visit a museum to take in a well-known art collection or learn more about a subject that interests you. Experience a special date night with a play at the theater. Or find tickets to your favorite band and see a live concert at the local music hall. And in Chicago, you don’t want to miss the Grant Park Music Festival.

No matter what your interests, big cities provide every type of entertainment for residents. While some options can be costly, museums and historic sites are often free or allow entrance for a small donation. The entertainment advantages of living in a big city like Chicago are endless.

#### Top Quality Restaurants and Shopping

Urban centers hold a multitude of opportunities for entertainment, but they also give residents myriad fine dining and shopping options. Cities like Chicago have served as cultural melting pots for decades, bringing together different types of people and expanding ethic restaurant options.

Want to get the best Mediterranean food for miles around? Try Avec, known for mouth-watering stuffed dates and beautiful minimalist décor. Ever tried Peruvian food? Visit Tanta to see what makes it one of the most popular restaurants in Chicago. If a good old-fashioned American meal is more up your alley, Joe’s Seafood, Prime Steak, & Stone Crab is a favorite spot for a thick, juicy steak and a classic cocktail.

For a little retail therapy, visit Chicago’s famous Magnificent Mile, where you can splurge at iconic department stores and discover trendy new boutiques. This expansive shopping center contains a spa and beauty center in case you need some pampering after an all-day shopping trip!

#### The Best Possible Medical Care

Medical care in rural areas simply cannot compete with the options available in a big city. Most people living in remote regions travel dozens of miles to visit a doctor, and specialist visits could become an overnight trip. Living in a big city gives you the opportunity to receive the highest caliber of medical care without traveling hours from your home.

Competition in cities drives medical centers to hire only the most knowledgeable staff, ensuring the finest care for you. More than a dozen hospitals in the Chicago area are nationally ranked for the quality of their medical care and superior staff. When it comes to finding a doctor in big cities like Chicago, you have unparalleled options and resources to get the care you need.
