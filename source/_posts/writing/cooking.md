#### Cheaper

Contrary to most beliefs, preparing your own meals often costs less than if you were to eat out or to purchase processed or even fast food. In most cases, not only are we paying for the raw materials used to create our food, but we are also paying for the brand, packaging, transport, and several other hidden costs that come with ready-made food. Though there is no guarantee that each meal you cook will always be cheaper in comparison to restaurant or store bought food, it will always end up saving you money in the long run.

Other than being able to save by making your own dishes from scratch, you are able to save even more by bringing your home-cooked leftovers to work instead of eating out for lunch. As a great bonus, the money that you save from cooking your own meals can be put to better use such as your travel fund, a brand new cute outfit, or perhaps in a year or so, you’ll find that you have saved up enough to spruce up your kitchen!

#### Healthier

One of the best things about preparing your own meals is that unlike eating out or purchasing already processed food, we have the advantage of knowing and monitoring exactly what goes into our food. We can make sure that there no preservatives or hidden fillers that are often included in ready-made dishes. By cooking our own food, we also have complete control to adjust recipes according to our preferences and needs. This makes it a lot easier for us to make healthier choices such as incorporating less salt, substituting meats for vegetables and so forth, unto our daily meals. Cooking our own meals not only enable us to create dishes that are made from fresh ingredients and are more delicious, we also give ourselves the freedom to plan and create a balanced diet. When we provide our body with balanced meals, it will leave us feeling more satisfied and help to reduce cravings for junk food and late-night snacking that often lead to weight gain.

#### Custom

You have control over the taste and health of what goes into your body. You can greatly reduce your ingestion of contaminants, chemicals, fertilizers, hormones, antibiotics, bacteria, and any other unwanted additives or preservatives. You have control over the nutritional value as well as the cooking methods of your food. You can re-discover how delicious and exquisite fresh, whole food tastes when you add your own herbs and spices and customize it to suit your own liking. Experimentation is key when combining tastes you like and exploring which foods you prefer for you and your family. 

#### Have Fun With Others

“ Nothing brings people together like great food ” they say and we found this to be true. Cooking meals at home give you the wonderful opportunity to include your family and friends in the process. More importantly, you get to share the fruits of your labor together. Though cooking is usually perceived as a peaceful and cathartic experience, it often brings laughter, excitement, and joy. Use your time in the kitchen with your loved ones to strengthen your bonds while creating priceless memories you will surely cherish for years to come.
