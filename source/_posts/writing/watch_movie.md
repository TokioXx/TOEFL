#### It is better to have control in your hands

A movie in the cinema is never going to pause. No matter what is going on in the cinema, it just goes on! Whether you want to pee, or get a coffee for you self if the movie is really making you sleepy, in short, no matter what it is, the movie has to roll. And it could be very difficult to understand plots when a couple of scenes missed, especially for complex movies, which could make you fairly disappointed. In constrast, in case of watching movie at home, this is all not possible. Pause it, play it, rewind it, skip it, or what ever want. It is all about you at home.
