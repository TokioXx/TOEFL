#### Communication Skills

Thereâ€™s a great deal of communication involved with effective teaching. Part of what makes a good teacher stand out is the ability to get messages across in lessons. However, the best teachers also are able to spark connections with students on a personal level. They must be able to communicate regularly with parents, with conferences and written reports alike. If there are problems in the classroom, a good teacher will reach out to the parents by phone or email to discuss the issues. A good teacher has a collaborative spirit, working effectively with colleagues and taking on suggestion or criticism.

#### Knowledge of subject matter

One of the first characteristics of a good teacher is a keen interest in their subject matter. When a teacher has a love for his or her subject, it shines through. This helps inspire interest in students, who pick up this enthusiasm. Think about it: knowledgeable teachers also have a wider bank of subject material to turn to in order to tailor the lesson to their individual students. Good teachers not only work with their existing knowledge, but strive to stay on top of the latest research in their field. This helps them make the subject come alive for pupils.

#### Excellent planning skills

Effective teaching involves a great deal of planning and organisation. Good teachers put in the effort to prepare their lessons thoroughly. Lesson planning helps manage student expectations, so that they know exactly what their obligations are. The grading policy should be clear, as should assignments and objectives. Part of what makes a good teacher is the ability to stay organised, maintaining accurate records and keeping track of individual student strengths and weaknesses. Clear expectations help keep the whole classroom stay on task.
