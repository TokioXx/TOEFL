#### start fresh

Sometimes you need to start a fresh life putting away your old habbits and your old self, and become the person you meant to be. This idea might be crazy, but it is what happen to me as well as many other people I know. It is especially the case for yound people who are transitioning from childhood to adulthood, and college is the perfect opportunity to get out of the of shell and become someone totally new. Once I was really not a proactive boy who can accomplish his assignments on time without the supervising of parents and teachers. Not surperisingly, I was really in a mass at the first year of the college, since no one is conducting me any more. Doing assignments, preparing for tests, writing papers and social events, I have a hard time in coping with all of these things. It seems impossible to finish all the staff within the limited time. Then, I learned to make timetables which effectively improved my time management, and this problem never happened in my life again. 

#### Achieve Independence

Most of them have never been far away from home and rely on their parents to make decisions. But this situation can not be hold though their entire live, since one day they have to leave their parents and build up their own family. However, university could be the place where help them achieve independence, they start to shoulder the responsibility of taking care of their lives and mature in decision-making which would have a long term positive effect on their future career and life.
